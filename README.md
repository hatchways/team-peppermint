# Peppermint chat app

The app designed to exchange messages between two people who speak completely different languages. Think: FB Messenger with a built-in automatic translator. If we could more easily speak to others from around the world, we would be a more inclusive and connected world!

To see the app on Netlify please click üëâ [Peppermint chat](https://peppermint-chat.netlify.app)

You can use the following user credentials(or create new user accounts):

email: andrey@mail.com<br />
password: qwerty123

email: aziz@mail.com<br />
password: qwerty123

## Synopsis

There are two main users:
1. The sender:
a. The sender sends messages in his/her chosen language
2. The receiver
a. The receiver receives messages in his/her chosen language
For example: Sender speaks English and Receiver speaks Chinese. The Sender sends ‚Äúwhat is your schedule for today?: and the receiver receives that message in Chinese. The receiver can then send Chinese back ‚ÄúI have 3 meetings and a dinner‚Äù, and the sender will receive this message back in English.

User can login/signup with email address. User can email invitation or referral link to sign up. When signing up the user can select primary language. User can accept friend request, search contacts by email or name. User can also join group chat.

## Peppermint Development Pipeline

The project uses continuous integration through Github, Circle Ci, and Netlify.

When any updates are pushed to dev branch, Circle Ci runs the app's Cypress and unit tests, if they pass, Circle Ci then updates the production branch in Github. Listening for updates to the production branch, Netlify will update when Circle Ci completes the tests, giving the app continous tested integration.
